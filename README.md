üöÄ ENDPOINT EFFICIENCY EXAMPLES
Smart Endpoint 1: Universal Like
POST /api/engagement/like/
Body: {
  content_type: "project" | "post" | "comment" | "event",
  content_id: "uuid"
}
One endpoint serves 4 content types!
Smart Endpoint 2: Create Event with Everything
POST /api/events/
Body: {
  event_details: {...},
  community_id: "uuid",  // Link to community
  linked_projects: ["project-id-1", "project-id-2"],  // Showcase existing
  agenda_items: [
    {title: "...", linked_project_id: "..."}  // REUSE
  ]
}
One endpoint creates event + links community + attaches projects + builds agenda
Smart Endpoint 3: Share Project in Community
POST /api/communities/{id}/posts/
Body: {
  post_type: "linked_project",
  linked_project_id: "existing-project-uuid",
  message: "Check out my research!"
}
No duplication - references existing project
Smart Endpoint 4: Batch Fetch User Activity
GET /api/users/{id}/activity/
Returns: {
  projects: [...],
  posts: [...],
  events_attended: [...],
  comments: [...],
  communities: [...]
}
One endpoint queries multiple tables efficiently

üéØ KEY IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLES
1. Create Once, Reference Many
‚Ä¢	Projects created once ‚Üí shared in communities, events, blogs
‚Ä¢	Users created once ‚Üí participate everywhere
‚Ä¢	Tags created once ‚Üí used across projects
2. Universal Tables for Universal Actions
‚Ä¢	Likes table serves all content
‚Ä¢	Comments table serves all content
‚Ä¢	Notifications table tracks all activities
3. Junction Tables with Metadata
‚Ä¢	CommunityMembers stores role, join date
‚Ä¢	EventAttendees stores registration status, check-in
‚Ä¢	ProjectTagAssociation can track creation date
4. Polymorphic Relationships
‚Ä¢	content_type + content_id pattern
‚Ä¢	Allows single table to reference multiple entities
‚Ä¢	Reduces table count dramatically
5. Caching Computed Values
‚Ä¢	Store counts (followers, projects, members)
‚Ä¢	Update via signals/triggers
‚Ä¢	Faster reads, occasional writes
6. Status & State Management
‚Ä¢	Use enums for all statuses
‚Ä¢	Draft ‚Üí Published workflows
‚Ä¢	Registration ‚Üí Approved flows
7. Soft Deletes
‚Ä¢	Add is_active or deleted_at fields
‚Ä¢	Never hard delete user content
‚Ä¢	Maintain data integrity
________________________________________
üìà EXPECTED TABLE COUNT
Core Tables: 25-28 tables
‚Ä¢	Users & Auth: 2 tables
‚Ä¢	Research: 4 tables
‚Ä¢	Communities: 3 tables
‚Ä¢	Events: 4 tables
‚Ä¢	Engagement: 4 tables (universal)
‚Ä¢	Knowledge: 3 tables
‚Ä¢	Notifications: 2 tables
‚Ä¢	Analytics: 2 tables
‚Ä¢	Junction Tables: 5-6 tables
Smart Design Result: Could have been 40+ tables, reduced to ~28 through reusability!
